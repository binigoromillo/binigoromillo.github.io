## Experience

### CS PhD | ARCADE Lab (JHU) (_Jan 24 - Present_)
- Leading the development of AI-based models and Mixed Reality tools for a Multi-robot System for Semi-automated Image-guided Vertebral Augmentation.

### DL Engineer | Vectech (_June 23 - Dec 24_)
- Optimized state-of-the-art fine-grained image classification models to introduce color distribution awareness into predictions.
- Created a SAM-based interactive interface that generates and fine-tunes YOLO-format segmentation masks in real time.
- Utilized GAN models to generate realistic intraspecies diversity features, employing them as an augmentation method to enhance variability within a fine-grained dataset.
- Effectively trained state-of-the-art object detection models on a challenging dataset of noisy and non-standardized phone images of ticks.

### AI/DL Researcher | I-STAR Lab (JHMI) (_Oct 22-July 23_)
- Under the mentorship of Dr. Alejandro Sisniega, evaluated the impact of noise correlation in cone-beam breast CT (bCT) images on self-supervised denoising methods to improve image quality without requiring matched low-dose and high-dose data.

### Test Analyst | Roche Diagnostics (_Aug 21-July 22_)
- Tested the software and hardware of the coagulation analyzer "Cobas t".
- Led updates to the test plans in line with the latest developments of the device.

### Radiation Oncology Researcher | Ramón y Cajal Hospital (_Sept 20-Jan 21_)
- Conducted a literature review on various immobilization systems for breast cancer treatment with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), including GammaPod®, CyberKnife®, and Bodyfix®.
- Led the design and development of a tumor segmentation app to train future radiologists in identifying cancerous tissue on biomedical images for radiotherapy.
- Tested the app with medical residents, demonstrating its effectiveness as a training tool.
