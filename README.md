### Experience
- CS PhD @ ARCADE Lab (JHU)
  Leading the development of AI-based models and Mixed Reality tools for a Multi-robot System for Semi-automated Image-guided Vertebral Augmentation.
- DL Engineer @ Vectech
  Optimization of state-of-the-art fine-grained image classification models to introduce color distribution awareness into the predictions.
  Creation of a SAM-based interactive interface that generates and finetunes YOLO-format segmentation masks in real time.
  Utilized GAN models to generate realistic intraspecies diversity features, employing them as an augmentation method to enhance variability within a fine-grained dataset.
  Effectively trained state-of-the-art object detection models on a challenging dataset of noisy and non-standardized phone images of ticks.
- AI/DL Researcher @ I-STAR Lab (JHMI)
  Under the mentorship of Dr. Alejandro Sisniega, I focused on evaluating the impact of noise correlation in cone-beam breast CT (bCT) images on self-supervised denoising methods to improve image quality without requiring matched low-dose and high-dose data.
- Test Analyst @ Roche Diagnostics
  Responsible for testing the SW and HW of the coagulation analyzer "Cobas t". Led the updates to the test plans in line with the latest developments of the device. 
- Radiation Oncology Researcher @ Ramón y Cajal Hospital
  I conducted a literature review on various immobilization systems for breast cancer treatment with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), including GammaPod®, CyberKnife®, and Bodyfix®. Additionally, I led the design and development of a tumor segmentation app to train future radiologists in identifying cancerous tissue on biomedical images for radiotherapy. The app was successfully tested by medical residents and demonstrated to be an effective training tool.
