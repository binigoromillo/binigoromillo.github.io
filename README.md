## About me
My work has focused on applying Deep Learning models for various medical applications, including diagnosis, surgical planning, and Mixed Reality guidance. My goal is to improve patient outcomes 
ensuring AI systems remain interpretable for smooth clinical integration. At the ARCADE Lab, I am currently developing the intelligent components for a novel Multi-robot System for Semi-automated Image-guided Vertebral Augmentation.

## Experience

### CS PhD | ARCADE Lab (JHU) 
*Jan 24 - Present*
- Leading the development of AI-based models and Mixed Reality tools for a Multi-robot System for Semi-automated Image-guided Vertebral Augmentation.

### DL Engineer | Vectech 
*June 23 - Dec 24*
- Optimized state-of-the-art fine-grained image classification models to introduce color distribution awareness into predictions.
- Created a SAM-based interactive interface that generates and fine-tunes YOLO-format segmentation masks in real time.
- Utilized GAN models to generate realistic intraspecies diversity features, employing them as an augmentation method to enhance variability within a fine-grained dataset.
- Effectively trained state-of-the-art object detection models on a challenging dataset of noisy and non-standardized phone images of ticks.

### AI/DL Researcher | I-STAR Lab (JHMI) 
*Oct 22-July 23*
- Under the mentorship of Dr. Alejandro Sisniega, evaluated the impact of noise correlation in cone-beam breast CT (bCT) images on self-supervised denoising methods to improve image quality without requiring matched low-dose and high-dose data.

### Test Analyst | Roche Diagnostics 
*Aug 21-July 22*
- Tested the software and hardware of the coagulation analyzer "Cobas t".
- Led updates to the test plans in line with the latest developments of the device.

### Radiation Oncology Researcher | Ramón y Cajal Hospital 
*Sept 20-Jan 21*
- Conducted a literature review on various immobilization systems for breast cancer treatment with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), including GammaPod®, CyberKnife®, and Bodyfix®.
